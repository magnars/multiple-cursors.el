# multiple-cursors.el [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/magnars/multiple-cursors.el.png)](http://travis-ci.org/magnars/multiple-cursors.el)

Multiple cursors for Emacs. This is some pretty crazy functionality, so yes,
there are kinks. Don't be afraid tho, I've been using it since 2011 with
great success and much merriment.

## Basic usage

Start out with:

    (require 'multiple-cursors)

Then you have to set up your keybindings - multiple-cursors doesn't presume to
know how you'd like them laid out. Here are some examples:

When you have an active region that spans multiple lines, the following will
add a cursor to each line:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-S-c") 'mc/edit-lines)

When you want to add multiple cursors not based on continuous lines, but based on
keywords in the buffer, use:

    (global-set-key (kbd "C->") 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-<") 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-c C-<") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)

First mark the word, then add more cursors.

To get out of multiple-cursors-mode, press `<return>` or `C-g`. The latter will
first disable multiple regions before disabling multiple cursors. If you want to
insert a newline in multiple-cursors-mode, use `C-j`.

## More commands to play around with

I've set up my key-bindings like so:

    ;; From active region to multiple cursors:
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-S-c") 'mc/edit-lines)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-e") 'mc/edit-ends-of-lines)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-S-c C-a") 'mc/edit-beginnings-of-lines)

When you have an active region that spans multiple lines, the preceeding three
commands will add one cursor to each line.

    ;; Rectangular region mode
    (global-set-key (kbd "H-SPC") 'set-rectangular-region-anchor)

Think of this one as `set-mark` except you're marking a rectangular region. It is
an exceedingly quick way of adding multiple cursors to multiple lines.

    ;; Mark more like this
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-æ") 'mc/mark-all-like-this)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-å") 'mc/mark-previous-like-this)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-æ") 'mc/mark-next-like-this)
    (global-set-key (kbd "C-Æ") 'mc/mark-more-like-this-extended)
    (global-set-key (kbd "M-å") 'mc/mark-all-in-region)

Okay, yes, I have a crazy norwegian keyboard. Regardless, these will look at
whatever you've got selected at the moment, and mark more places like that in
the buffer.

If you would like to keep the global bindings clean, and get custom keybindings
when the region is active, you can try [region-bindings-mode](https://github.com/fgallina/region-bindings-mode).

BTW, I highly recommend adding `mc/mark-next-like-this` to a key binding that's
right next to the key for `er/expand-region`.

## Scrolling

Sometimes you end up with cursors outside of your view. You can scroll the
screen to center on each cursor with `C-v` and `M-v`.

## Unknown commands

Multiple-cursors uses two lists of commands to know what to do: the run-once list
and the run-for-all list. It comes with a set of defaults, but it would be beyond silly
to try and include all the known Emacs commands.

So that's why multiple-cursors occasionally asks what to do about a command. It will
then remember your choice by saving it in `~/.emacs.d/.mc-lists.el`. You can change
the location with:

    (setq mc/list-file "/my/preferred/file")


## Known limitations

* isearch-forward and isearch-backward aren't supported with multiple cursors.
  You should feel free to add a simplified version that can work with it.
* Commands run with `M-x` won't be repeated for all cursors.
* All key bindings that refer to lambdas are always run for all cursors. If you
  need to limit it, you will have to give it a name.
* Redo might screw with your cursors. Undo works very well.


## Contribute

Yes, please do. There's a suite of tests, so remember to add tests for your
specific feature, or I might break it later.

You'll find the repo at:

    https://github.com/magnars/multiple-cursors.el

To fetch the test dependencies:

    $ cd /path/to/multiple-cursors
    $ git submodule update --init

Run the tests with:

    $ ./util/ecukes/ecukes --graphical

* [segv](https://github.com/segv) contributed looping to mc/cycle and adding cursors without region for mark-more.

Thanks!
